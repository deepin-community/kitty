kitty (0.31.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

    Text rendering change: Use sRGB correct linear gamma blending for nicer
    font rendering and better color accuracy with transparent windows. To
    return to the old method for how glyphs are composited, set
    `text_composition_strategy legacy` in kitty's configuration file. This
    will make dark text on light backgrounds look thicker and light text on
    dark backgrounds thinner. It might also make some text appear like the
    strokes are uneven.
